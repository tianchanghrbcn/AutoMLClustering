# AutoMLClustering

This project implements an automated machine learning pipeline for clustering tasks, supporting various data preprocessing, error correction, clustering methods, and result analysis.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or above
- Linux-based system (tested on Ubuntu)
- Required packages (installed via `config.sh`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:username/AutoMLClustering.git
   cd AutoMLClustering
   ```

2. Run the configuration script to set up the virtual environment and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   bash config.sh
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

## Running the Project

### Step 1: Data Preprocessing
Navigate to the `src/pipeline/train` directory and run the preprocessing script:

```bash
cd src/pipeline/train
python pre-processing.py
```

### Step 2: Start the Training Pipeline
Run the training pipeline in the background using `nohup` to ensure it continues running even if the session is disconnected:

```bash
nohup python training_pipeline.py > output.log 2>&1 &
```

- The output and logs will be saved to the `output.log` file.

## Logs and Outputs

- Logs are saved in `output.log`.
- Intermediate results are stored in the `results` directory.

## Notes

- Ensure all paths in the scripts are correctly configured relative to the project root.
- If you encounter permission issues, ensure you have the required privileges or use `sudo` cautiously.
